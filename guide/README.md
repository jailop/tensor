# Legacy Transformer Implementation Guide

**Note:** These documents are from a previous transformer implementation project
and are kept for reference purposes. The current project is a **C++ Tensor Library**
with automatic differentiation, BLAS/GPU acceleration, and comprehensive linear
algebra features.

For current project documentation, see the main [README.md](../README.md).

## Contents

These guides cover transformer architecture and optimization techniques:

1. **01_system_role.md** - Transformer algorithm fundamentals
2. **02_implementation_strategy.md** - Data structures and optimization strategies  
3. **03_vectorization.md** - SIMD vectorization techniques
4. **04_scalability.md** - Memory management and scaling
5. **05_production.md** - Testing and deployment

The implementation examples in these files reference a different codebase
but the concepts remain valuable for understanding ML systems optimization.
